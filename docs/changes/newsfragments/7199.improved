`qcodes.dataset.descriptions.detect_shapes` and `qcodes.dataset.dond.do_nd_utils` have been updated
to use `parameter.register_name` when creating shape dictionaries for storage in the dataset

Previously, these methods used `parameter.full_name` which could result in shapes not being stored
or used correctly for parameters that use `parameter.register_name`
